                    The advent of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 precipitated
                    a major reorganization of contemporary social and
                    economic relations, while also calling into
                    questions a variety of individual and collective
                    habits. For most of us in the West, the pandemic
                    appears as an "unprecedented" event; and yet, it
                    has many antecedents in recent and distant
                    history. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian">Justinian Plague</a>
                    may well have brought down the East Roman Empire, while
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_disease_and_epidemics#Smallpox">Smallpox</a> devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics">Cholera Pandemics</a> raced across the Eurasian landmass in the early Nineteenth Century,
                    and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html">Invluenza Pandemic of 1918-19</a> killed millions.

                    Can we understand our present and future by making sense of the past?
